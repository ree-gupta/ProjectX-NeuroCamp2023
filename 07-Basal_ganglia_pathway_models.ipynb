    "\n",
    "Using Neuronify, set up the direct basal ganglia motor loop, referencing the diagram in notebook 6. Ensure all your neurons are of the \"leaky\" type. Connect the GPi neurons and the VL thalamus neurons to standard (regular) spike generators, noting that they usually exhibit spontaneous activity. Fix a touch activator to the neurons of the prefrontal cortex and the substantia nigra. Link a voltmeter to the neurons in the motor cortex. To replicate the authentic function of the basal ganglia, you may need to tweak the spike generators' settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activate the direct pathway by pressing on the touch activator. Once the prefrontal cortex neurons stimulate the putamen adequately (consider this as the neurons indicating \"ample activity to validate this motion\"), it will pave the way for the premotor cortex to initiate the movement. Elaborate on this mechanism using your constructed model.\n",
