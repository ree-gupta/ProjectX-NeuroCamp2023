## Books:

- "Theoretical Neuroscience: Computational and Mathematical Modeling of Neural Systems" by Peter Dayan and Larry F. Abbott.

- "Fundamentals of Computational Neuroscience" by Thomas Trappenberg. This book covers basic concepts of computational neuroscience and would be helpful for beginners.

- "Neuronal Dynamics: From single neurons to networks and models of cognition" online book by Wulfram Gerstner, Werner M. Kistler, Richard Naud and Liam Paninski. This book has a free online verion [here](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/index.html) and also has [coding excercises](https://neuronaldynamics-exercises.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to suppplement the learning.


## Online Courses:
