## NeuroCamp

[NeuroCamp](https://www.neurocamp-munich.com/) is an international, annual summer camp in Munich for high school students. It is organized by students and young researchers from different universities and research institutes in Munich. Our aim is to get students enthusiastic about the fascinating field of Neuroscience and promote their interest in science in general.

### Project X - Demystifying Neural Activity Through Models & Code

The project will allow students to get a hands-on introduction to the exciting field of computational neuroscience and explore how neuroscientists build models that demystify the "What?", "Why?", and "How?" of neuronal activity.
They will build and explore Python and GUI ([Neuronify](https://ovilab.net/neuronify/)) based neuron simulations, beginning with simple models and progressing to neural networks. By the end of the project, students will have applied their newfound knowledge to simulate and describe experimental findings and how they relate to observed behavior. In particular, they will have a look at the direct and the indirect pathway in the basal ganglia and simulate these pathways using small networks of neurons using neuronify.

Also, they will get a short introduction to exciting experiments to understand color perception using psychophysics and modeling studies.


### Requirements

There are no system requirements. All the notebooks and experiments can be run in the browser without any additional installations, using google colaboratory and neuronify. Use the "Open in colab" buttons below to open and explore each of the notebooks. The notebooks are self-contained for most parts and can be followed sequentially.
